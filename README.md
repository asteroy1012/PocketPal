# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

PostGreSQL codes for creating the necessary tables under the database name PocketPal
Follow this for PostGreSQL:
-- 1. Create the 'users' table to store login information
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 2. Create the 'groups' table
CREATE TABLE groups (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), -- Links to the user who created it
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 3. Create the 'group_members' table to link users and groups
-- This table establishes the many-to-many relationship
CREATE TABLE group_members (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    group_id INTEGER REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, group_id) -- Ensures a user can't join the same group twice
);


-- 4. IMPORTANT: Modify your existing 'expenses' table
-- First, rename it to 'personal_expenses'
ALTER TABLE expenses RENAME TO personal_expenses;

-- Second, add a column to link each expense to a user
ALTER TABLE personal_expenses ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id);
